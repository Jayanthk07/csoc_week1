-->information ctf
by doing exiftool cat.jpg , to check the metadata , we see some sus string in license part , it may be base64 , so i decoded it , then the flag came --> picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}

-->Matryoshka doll
now i do binwalk -e dolls.jpg to extrat any hidden files 
the i go to the hidden directory , there i found another jpg , then i extractd again with binwalk and now , it repeats until i get the flag , the series of commands are given bellow
binwalk -e dolls.jpg
cd _dolls.jpg.extracted/
unzip 4286C.zip 
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 2_c.jpg 
cd _2_c.jpg.extracted/
unzip 2DD3B.zip
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 3_c.jpg 
cd _3_c.jpg.extracted/
unzip 1E2D6.zip 
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 4_c.jpg 
cd _4_c.jpg.extracted/
cat flag.txt
and the flag is picoCTF{4cf7ac000c3fb0fa96fb92722ffb2a32}




-->tunn3l v1s10n
in this thing i tried to examine the file here , but by doing file tunn3l_v1s10n, it shows its , just data
now i use exiftool to see the metadata, there it shows , that its a bmp file , so i changed the file name to kk.bmp
now i tried opeing but , it was not opening , so i thouhgt it is corrupt and opened hexdump to check the header , yes it was
corrupt , i corrected the header, yet the image opened and showed a false flag , so i though image dimensions are sus 
so i changed the shape and extended it horizontally , it gave me the flag
picoCTF{qu1t3_a_v13w_2020}



-->MacroHard WeakEdge
in this challange m there is pptm given , as its linux i convert it to a zip file and opened it , by extracting it , hence
after seeing all files and subfiles in it i see at file names hidden , so i opened it ,and it was a base64 wth gaps , so after decoding it , i get the flag
flag: picoCTF{D1d_u_kn0w_ppts_r_z1p5}


-->Enhance
in this challange we have to analyse an svg image , its coded , not like a normal image, i just opened it by using cat drawing.flag.svg
there i got the flag , picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_d0a757bf}



-->advanced-potion-making
this is same as the header changing in the file it seemed like a  png, so i changes the headers according to png and saved it and added .png
now , using java -jar and tried some combinations , there i got the flag picoCTF{wiz4rdry}



-->File types
in this one we have to identify the file compression type anad see how to decompress it and keep going , some types of decompressors may not be there, install them and proceed with the following steps to get the flag
the format is like filetype , compression type , decompression it with either code or normally by opening it.we find out the type and then rename it accrodingly
some may show the false types and some may not even show any types by just seeing them  so we use file command.
.ar
archieve
open it 
.cpio
open it 
.bzip2
rename to .bz2
bzip2 -d flag.bz2
.gz
rename it with .gz
gunzip -d flag.gz
.lzip 
rename it to .lzip
lzip -d flag.lzip
.lz4
rename it to .lz4
lz4 -d flag.lz4
shows binary but is .lzma
rename it to .lzma
lzma -d flag.lzma
.lzo
rename it to .lzo
lzop -d flag.lzo
.lzip 
rename as .lzip
lzip -d flag.lzip
.xz
rename it as .xz
xz -d flag.xz
in the middle we may come across some file which appear  to be like bin or anything else , better check every file using file command
then u get a text file and that is in hex , now convert it back , there is ur flag picoCTF{filen@m3_m@n1pul@t10n_f0r_0b2cur17y_3c79c5ba}



-->hideme
in this challange we analyse the file an use binwalk to extract the hidden files , and in those i seee a file named hidden , now i go into that and i get the flas which is picoCTF{Hiddinng_An_imag3_within_@n_ima9e_d55982e8}


-->MSB
in this one, after reading thorugh it we can undestand that by seeing the image the bit already here is the msot significant bit , hence we use stegsolve tool to do this one 
after using stegsolve by putting rgb values at 777 (which means msb) get the we  flag . here we have to extract the data.
flag is obtained after checking the whole message  picoCTF{15_y0ur_que57_ qu1x071c_0r_h3r0 1c_3a219174}


-->extensions
in this challange we understand that file extension is wrong as , after opening it , it looked clumsy , so lets check what kinda file it is using exiftool
it comes out to be a png from the metadata , so i rename it to .png and open it and there is the flag --> picoCTF{now_you_know_about_extensions}
