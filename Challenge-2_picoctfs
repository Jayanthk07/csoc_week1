-->information ctf
by doing exiftool cat.jpg , to check the metadata , we see some sus string in license part , it may be base64 , so i decoded it , then the flag came --> picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}

-->Matryoshka doll
now i do binwalk -e dolls.jpg to extrat any hidden files 
the i go to the hidden directory , there i found another jpg , then i extractd again with binwalk and now , it repeats until i get the flag , the series of commands are given bellow
binwalk -e dolls.jpg
cd _dolls.jpg.extracted/
unzip 4286C.zip 
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 2_c.jpg 
cd _2_c.jpg.extracted/
unzip 2DD3B.zip
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 3_c.jpg 
cd _3_c.jpg.extracted/
unzip 1E2D6.zip 
cd base_images/
binwalk -e 4_c.jpg 
cd _4_c.jpg.extracted/
cat flag.txt
and the flag is picoCTF{4cf7ac000c3fb0fa96fb92722ffb2a32}




-->tunn3l v1s10n
in this thing i tried to examine the file here , but by doing file tunn3l_v1s10n, it shows its , just data
now i use exiftool to see the metadata, there it shows , that its a bmp file , so i changed the file name to kk.bmp
now i tried opeing but , it was not opening , so i thouhgt it is corrupt and opened hexdump to check the header , yes it was
corrupt , i corrected the header, yet the image opened and showed a false flag , so i though image dimensions are sus 
so i changed the shape and extended it horizontally , it gave me the flag
picoCTF{qu1t3_a_v13w_2020}



-->MacroHard WeakEdge
in this challange m there is pptm given , as its linux i convert it to a zip file and opened it , by extracting it , hence
after seeing all files and subfiles in it i see at file names hidden , so i opened it ,and it was a base64 wth gaps , so after decoding it , i get the flag
flag: picoCTF{D1d_u_kn0w_ppts_r_z1p5}


-->Enhance
in this challange we have to analyse an svg image , its coded , not like a normal image, i just opened it by using cat drawing.flag.svg
there i got the flag , picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_d0a757bf}

-->advanced-potion-making
i extracted the files from this using binwalk -e advanced-potion-making
now cd _advanced-potion-making-0.extracted
