first we move to the dictory where the accesss.log is there --> cd Desktop/artefacts
now we analyse the access.log file by for the answers
1) we check the filed and apply this command --> cut -d ' ' -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l
    this command gives the no of uniq ips in the access.log
2) cut -d ' ' -f3 access.log | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
   this command gives the no of uniq domains visited , we have analysed the fields to do this 
3)cut -d ' ' -f3 access.log | cut -d ':' -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr 
  the top one gives the least acccessed domain , now we use this to acces the http request of that
  grep "least_accessed" access.log | cut -d ' ' -f6 
  this gives the answer
4)the one with more connections, and excluding some obvious ones we can get the asnwer from the (2) or (3) 
5)and now from the present data we use ---> grep "sus_domain" access.log , we can see the ip address from this data
6)now just appending | wc -l , will give us the number of requests made by the malicious domain 
7)we now need to anlyse th requests of the sus_domain , and in that we can find the sus field which may traner the data , which is goodies column
 and it also looks like a base 64 so -->grep "sus_domain" access.log | cut -d ' ' -f5 | cut -d '=' -f2 | base64 -d

looks like we need a tool named FTK imager here , which helps a lot in Disc forensics, so lets get into it
this provides an env to teset our things without infecting the actual pc
lets add the item and start the analysis
1)I see a dont open folder , which is sus , so i open it and read the secret.txt sus thing and ther we go , we get the server name in chats(mcgreedysecretc2.thm)
2)now we can see that zip archieve named "JuicyTomaTOY.zip" and the file inside it is "JuicyTomaTOY.exe"
3)we go back to the root , and see there are some png , lets convert them into hex ,and search for our flag , by using the ctrl+F , the flag is THM{byt3-L3vel_@n4Lys15}
4)right click on the physical drive that u attached , now select verify drive image , then it will give u all the hashes , sha1 = 39f2dea6ffb43bf80d80f19d122076b3682773c2

now we have to use the volatility tool to analyse the memory , this is for RAM (volatile memory), we dont have linux version available directly , but we have it already setup for us in another
directory hence , i copy it to my directory where i wanna analyse the evidence -->  cp Ubuntu_5.4.0-163-generic_profile.zip ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux/
it actually needs a memory dump to analyse , which we could get through lime extracter , already given in a directory for this challenge
now its all setup and i can go through the questions,using some basic volatility commands
1)we search through the command history --> vol.py -f linum.mem --profile="LinuxUbuntu_5_4_0-163-generic_profilex64" linux_bash
  from this history we get the password which is NEhX4VSrN7sV, we get it by observing this from the sql command where this thign is after the -p tag
2)now we use another volatility command to observe the proccesses  vol.py -f linum.mem --profile="LinuxUbuntu_5_4_0-163-generic_profilex64" linux_pslist
  from this we can see what is the pid and ppids of the proccesses , for miner it is 10280
3)now we will create a new directory --> mkdir extracted , to extract the binary data of the sus proccesses to that
  vol.py -f linum.mem --profile="LinuxUbuntu_5_4_0-163-generic_profilex64" linux_procdump -D extracted -p PID , here in the PID's we can use the pids , from (2)
  md5sum extracted/miner.PID.0x400000  we can use these commands to get the md5 sum
4)same as above
5)strings extracted/miner.<PID from question 2>.0x400000 | grep http://         from this commands we get the url that we need , now we need to use cyberchef to defang it
  and now we get the defanged url    "hxxp[://]mcgreedysecretc2[.]thm"
6)we look at the cron jobs to analyse sus --->vol.py -f linux.mem --profile="LinuxUbuntu_5_4_0-163-generic_profilex64" linux_enumerate_files | grep -i cron
  there we go we find elfie , lets extract it to the extract directory using --> vol.py -f linux.mem --profile="LinuxUbuntu_5_4_0-163-generic_profilex64" linux_find_file -i 0xffff9ce9b78280e8 -O extracted/elfie 
  check ls extracted/
  and do cat elfie --> there we go we can see the location of mysql server there /var/tmp/.system-python3.8-Updates/mysqlserver
